            elements without the express written permission from Juris Manager.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.4 	Authorised Users agree not to modify, reverse engineer, adapt or otherwise tamper 
            with the Service or modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with

        </p>
        <p>
            2.5 	Authorised Users agree that they will not knowingly use the Service in any manner 
            which may infringe copyright or intellectual property rights or in any manner which is

        </p>
        <p>
            2.6  	Authorised Users agree that they will not knowingly use the Service to upload, 
            post, host, or transmit unsolicited bulk email “Spam”, short message service “SMS” messages,

            malicious nature.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.7 	Except for the non-exclusive license granted pursuant to this Agreement, Subscriber 
            acknowledges and agrees that all ownership, license, intellectual property and other rights 
            and interests in and to the Service shall remain solely with Juris Manager. Title to, and 
            all Intellectual Property Rights in the Services, the Website and any documentation relating 
            to the Services remain the property of Juris Manager (or its licensors).
        </p>
        <p>
            2.8 	Authorised Users who configure the Service to share or make available certain 
            Content to the public, are deemed to acknowledge and agree that everyone will have access 
            to the Content (“Public Content”). It is the responsibility of the Authorised User to 
            determine if the Service being shared is appropriate for each Registered User. Juris 
            Manager reserves the right, at any time, in its sole discretion, to take any action deemed 
            necessary with respect to Public Content that violates the terms of this Agreement,

        </p>

            2.9  Juris Manager reserves the right at any time, and from time to time, to modify 
            or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any feature associated with the Service, with 
            or without notice, except that Juris Manager shall provide Subscriber with 30-days notice 
            of any modification that materially reduces the functionality of the Service. Continued 
            use of the Service following any modification constitutes Subscriber’s acceptance of the 
            modification.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.10 	Juris Manager reserves the right to temporarily suspend access to the Service for 
            operational purposes, including, but not limited to, maintenance, repairs or installation 
            of upgrades. Where possible, notice shall be provided to you in advance through by way of 
            notification within the Service, email or other notification method deemed appropriate by 
            Juris Manager. Further, Juris Manager shall endeavour to confine planned operational 
            suspensions with a best effort to minimise disruption to the Subscriber, but reserves the 
            ability to temporarily suspend operations without notice at any time to complete necessary 
            repairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.11 	Juris Manager stores all Content on redundant storage servers. The Subscriber may 
            elect to, at a regular interval, replicate all Content associated with the subscription to 
            a third party storage service (“Escrow Agent”). The replicated Content (“Escrowed Data”) 
            will be held under the terms of a separate agreement exclusively between the Subscriber and

        </p>
        <p>
            2.12 	Subscriber grants to Juris Manager a non-exclusive, royalty-free right during 
            Subscriber’s use of the Service, to use the Confidential Information for the sole purpose 
            of performing Juris Manager’ obligations under the Agreement in accordance with the terms 
            of the Agreement. Such rights shall include permission for Juris Manager to generate and 
            publish aggregate, anonymized reports on system usage and Content trends and type, provided 
            they do not conflict with Section 4.1.
        </p>
        <p>
            2.13 	Juris Manager uses one code-base for all jurisdictions. Subscriber is required, 
            using settings available within the Service, to configure the Service for its own 
            jurisdiction and to verify that the settings meet the Subscriber’s requirements.  
        </p>
        <p>
            2.14 	Juris Manager does not provide any legal advice. Juris Manager is not a legal 
            firm, and the employees of Juris Manager are not representing you or acting as your 
            solicitor. Your use of Juris Manager does not create a solicitor-client relationship 
            between you and Juris Manager, any of the employees of Juris Manager or any advocate you 
            may work with that use Juris Manager.
        </p>

        <strong>3. Access to the Service</strong>
        <p>
            3.1 	Subscriber is only permitted to access and use the Service if he/she is an 
            Authorised User or a Registered Client. Authorised Users are required to provide their 
            full legal name, a valid email address, and any other information reasonably requested 
            by the Service. 
        </p>
        <p>
            3.2 	Each Authorised User will be provided with a unique identifier to access and use 
            the Service (“Username”). The Username shall only be used by the Authorised User to whom it 
            is assigned, and shall not be shared with, or used by any other person, including other 
            Authorised Users.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.3 	The initial Administrator shall be the Primary Subscriber with authority to 
            administer the subscription and designate additional Authorised Users and/or Administrators. 
            Each subscription may designate multiple Authorised Users as Administrator. Any 
            Administrator shall be deemed to have the authority to manage the subscription and any 
            Authorised Users. The Administrator will deactivate an active Username if the Administrator 
            wishes to terminate access to the Service for any Authorised User.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.4 	Administrators are responsible for all use of the Service by Authorised Users on the 
            list of active Authorised Users associated with their subscription to the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.5 	As between Juris Manager and the Subscriber, any Content uploaded or posted to 
            the Service remains the property of the Subscriber. Upon Cancellation or Termination of 
            Service as discussed in Section 10 below, Juris Manager shall only be responsible for the 
            return of Content directly to the Administrator or a designated Authorised User in the event 
            that the Administrator is unable to be reached.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.6 	All access to and use of the Service via mechanical, programmatic, robotic, scripted 
            or any other automated means not provided as part of the Service is strictly prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.7 	Authorised Users are permitted to access and use the Service using an Application 
            Program Interface (“API”) subject to the following conditions: 
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    any use of the Service using an API, including use of an API through a third-party 
                    product that accesses and uses the Service, is governed by these Terms of Service;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Juris Manager shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, 
                    consequential or exemplary damages, including but not limited to, damages for loss of 
                    profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses (even if Juris Manager has been 
                    advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from any use of an API or 
                    third-party products that access and use the Service via an API;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Excessive use of the Service using an API may result in temporary or permanent 
                    suspension of access to the Service via an API. Juris Manager, in its sole 
                    discretion, will determine excessive use of the Service via an API, and will make a 
                    reasonable attempt to warn the Authorised User prior to suspension; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Juris Manager reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily 
                    or permanently, access and use of the Service via an API, with or without notice.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            3.8 	As a condition of these Terms, when accessing and using the Services, 
            Subscriber must:
            <ol type="a">
                <li>
                    not attempt to undermine the security or integrity of Juris Manager’s computing 
                    systems or networks or, where the Services are hosted by a third party, that third party's 
                    computing systems and networks;
                </li>
                <li>
                    not use, or misuse, the Services in any way which may impair the functionality of the 
                    Services or Website, or other systems used to deliver the Services or impair the ability 
                    of any other user to use the Services or Website;
                </li>
                <li>
                    not attempt to gain unauthorised access to any materials other than those to which you 
                    have been given express permission to access or to the computer system on which the 
                    Services are hosted;
                </li>
                <li>
                    use any robot, spider, site search/retrieval application, or another automated device, 
                    process or means to access, retrieve or index any portion of the Website and the Services;
                </li>
                <li>
                    reformat or frame any portion of the web pages that are part of the Website and the Services; 
                </li>
                <li>
                    not transmit, or input into the Website, any files that may damage any other persons 
                    computing devices or software, content that may be offensive, or material or Data in 
                    violation of any law (including Data or other material protected by copyright or trade 
                    secrets which you do not have the right to use);
                </li>
                <li>
                    create user accounts by automated means or under false or fraudulent pretences;
                </li>
                <li>
                    remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices contained in or on 
                    the Site and the Services or in or on any content or other material obtained via the

                </li>
                <li>
                    not attempt to modify, copy, adapt, reproduce, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer 
                    any computer programs used to deliver the Services or to operate the Website except as is 
                    strictly necessary to use either of them for normal operation.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            3.9   While juris manager intends that the service should be available twenty-four (24) hours 
            a day, seven days a week, it is possible that on occasions the service or website may be 
            unavailable to permit maintenance or other development activity to take place. If for any 
            reason juris manager has to interrupt the service for more extended periods than juris 
            manager would generally expect, juris manager will use reasonable endeavours to publish 
            in advance details of such activity on the website.
        </p>

            4.1 	Each party agrees to treat all Confidential Information as confidential and not 
            to use or disclose such Confidential Information except as necessary to perform its 
            obligations under this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            4.2      Juris Manager and any third party vendors and hosting partners it utilises to provide 
            the Service shall hold Content in confidence and shall not use or disclose Content except 
            (a) as required to perform their obligations under this Agreement at the discretion of 
            Juris Manager; (b) in compliance with Section 7 of this Agreement, or (c) as otherwise 
            Authorised by you in writing.
        </p>
       
        <strong>5. 	Security and Access</strong>
        <p>
            5.1 	Subscriber will be responsible for protecting the security of usernames and 
            passwords, or any other codes associated to the Service, and for the accuracy and adequacy 
            of personal information provided to the Service.
        </p>
        <p>
            5.2 	Subscriber will implement policies and procedures to prevent unauthorised use 
            of usernames and passwords and will promptly notify Juris Manager upon suspicion that a 
            username and password has been lost, stolen, compromised, or misused.
        </p>
        <p>
            5.3 	At all times, Juris Manager, and any third party vendors and hosting

            If Juris Manager is required by law to make any disclosure of the Confidential Information

            provide Subscriber with prompt written notice (to the extent permitted by law) prior to such

            Confidential Information that it is legally compelled or otherwise legally required to 
            disclose.

            or termination of Service for any reason, Subscriber shall have ninety (90) days to 
            retrieve any and all Content. 
        </p>

        <strong>9. 	Payment, Refunds, and Subscription Changes</strong>
        <p>
            9.1 	Subscribers with paid subscriptions will provide Juris Manager with a valid credit 
            card for payment of the applicable subscription fees. All subscription fees are exclusive 
            of all federal, state, provincial, municipal, or other taxes which Subscribers agree to 
            pay. Invoices will include (i) subscription fees and (ii) all applicable digital, sales 
            or services taxes, as amended from time to time. In the event of updated tax rates, 
            Juris Manager will apply the new tax rate without notice to the Subscriber. In addition 
            to any fees, the Subscriber may still incur charges incidental to using the Service, for
            example, charges for Internet access, data roaming, and other data transmission charges. 
        </p>
        <p>
            9.2 	Subscribers with monthly paying subscriptions will be charged upon the expiration of 
            any applicable free trial period. Subscriptions cancelled prior to the expiration of any 
            trial period, will not be charged. Monthly Subscribers will thereafter be charged in 
            advance each 30 days. Annual Subscribers will thereafter be charged annually on the 
            anniversary date of the initial subscription charge. All charges are final and 
            non-refundable, including payments made by Annual Subscribers, setup fees, and other 
            professional services charges.

            Subscribers who purchased setup or professional services, like tailored live 
            training, customised forms and documents, or migration services, must initiate 
            those services within sixty (60) days (Service Window) following their purchase. 
            Absent a separate invoice, the date of purchase for setup or professional services 
            will be deemed to be the initial date of entry of a valid credit card for payment 
            as required in §9.1. Failure of the Subscriber to initiate purchased setup or 
            professional services within Service Window will result in those services no longer 
            being available and no refund will be issued. 
        </p>
        <p>
            9.3 	No refunds or credits will be issued for partial periods of service,

            cancelled prior to the end of their current billing cycle will not be charged again in 
            the following cycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            9.5 	The amount charged on the next billing cycle will be automatically updated to 
            reflect any changes to the subscription, including upgrades or downgrades, and including 
            the addition or removal of discounts included for the purchase of suite services. Adding 
            Authorised User subscriptions or subscription upgrades will trigger prorated charges in 
            the current billing cycle. Subscriber authorizes Juris Manager to apply updated charge 
            amounts. Subscription changes, including downgrades, may result in loss of access to 
            Content, features, or an increase or reduction in the amount of available capacity for 
            Content provided by the Service.
        </p>

            exemption certificate Authorised by the appropriate taxing authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            9.8 	Any and all payments by or on account of the compensation payable under this
            Agreement shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for any 
            taxes. If the Subscriber is required to deduct or withhold any taxes from such payments, 
            then the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that, after making all required 
            deductions or withholdings, Juris Manager receives an amount equal to the sum it would 
            have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
        </p>

        <strong>10. 	Cancellation and Termination</strong>

            inaction to a Security Emergency; (c) is deemed unsuitable to Juris Manager without 
            assigning any reason whatsoever.

            subscription in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

            11.1 	Except in the case of a violation by Juris Manager of its obligations under 
            Section 4 above (“Confidentiality”), Section 5 above (“Security and Access”), and Section 
            8 above (“Managed Backup and Archiving”), and except as provided in Section 13.2 below 
            (“Indemnification”), Juris Manager shall not be liable for and Subscriber waives the right 
            to claim any loss, injury, claim, liability or damage of any kind resulting in any way

            regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence),

            manager has been advised of the possibility of those damages. These disclaimers are not 
            applicable to the indemnification obligation set forth in section 13.2. Each provision of 
            this agreement that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of damages, or 
            exclusion of damages is to allocate the risks of this agreement between the parties. This 
            allocation is reflected in the pricing offered by juris manager to subscriber and is an 
            essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions 
            is severable from and independent of all other provisions of this agreement.

            to use, the site and the services. These exclusions apply to any claims for lost profits, 
            lost data, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, any other

            such damages.
