    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2> 
    <p>Last Updated: 21 June 2020</p>

    <p>This privacy policy (this Privacy Policy) describes the collection of Personal 
        Information (described below) by Juris Manager LLP, (Juris Manager, we, or us)
        from users of our website at www.jurismanager.com (the Website), as well as all
        related applications, widgets, software, tools, and other services provided by 
        us and on which a link to this Privacy Policy is displayed (collectively, together 
        with the Website, our Service). This Policy also describes our use and disclosure of 
        such information. By using our Service, you consent to the collection, use, and
        disclosure of Personal Information per this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy 
        is subject to the provisions of Juris Manager's Terms of Use that incorporate this
        Privacy Policy by reference.
    </p>

    <strong>Information Collection and Use</strong>
    <p>
        Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like
        your name, photograph, physical address, email address, phone number, payment 
        information, and that is not otherwise publicly available. Personal Information also
        includes information about a person’s activities, such as information about his or 
        her activity on our Service, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender,
        geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to Personal
        Information that identifies that individual.
    </p>
    <p>
        We may receive information about you, including Personal Information, from third parties, 
        and may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you.
        If we do so, this Privacy Policy governs any combined information that we keep in a 
        personally identifiable format.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personal Information does not include aggregate or other non-personally identifiable
        information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or 
        category of products, services, or users that is not personally identifiable or from
        which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information, 
        and other non-personally identifiable information, for various purposes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Although information uploaded to the Service by a Juris Manager user for processing 
        and storage (Customer Data) may include information that correctly identifies an 
        individual (e.g., a Juris Manager user could upload to the Service information about 
        its clients in order to perform legal services for those customers via the Service, 
        including information that identifies individuals such as name and email address
        explicitly), that information is not Personal Information for the purposes of this
        Privacy Policy. Please see the Customer Data and Security section below for information 
        regarding Juris Managers handling of Customer Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        The App will only use access to read, write, modify or control email message bodies 
        (including attachments), metadata, headers, and settings to provide a web email client 
        that allows users to compose, send, read, and process emails and will not transfer this
        email data to others unless doing so is necessary to provide and improve these features,
        comply with applicable law, or as part of a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets. 
        The App will not use this email data for serving advertisements.
    </p>
    <p>
        App’s use of information received, and App’s transfer of information to any other app, 
        from Google APIs will adhere to Google’s Limited Use Requirements.

    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, in the event of a sale, merger, or acquisition of some, or all of Juris Manager
        LLP assets, your personal information would likely be a part of the transferred assets. 
        In such an event, we shall notify you via email of your choices as a user, and on how

    </p>

    <strong>Cookies</strong>
    <p>

        while on our Website. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our Service. The 
        only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our Website. 
        Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the 
        experience on our Website. 
    </p>
    <p>

        to our Website.
    </p>

    <p>
        We use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer the site, track users’ movement, and
        gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to 
        Personal Information. The statistics program on our web server and other analytics and 
        security programs trusted third party service providers collect aggregate information on
        what pages users access or visit which we use for internal review and to improve our 
        content.

    <p>
